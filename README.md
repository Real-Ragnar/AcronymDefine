# AcronymDefine
Find acronyms in the text and produce its description.

Steps to Run:
1. Run .py file in an IDE. I used IDLE.
2. In the opened console, paste in the text you would like to parse for its acronyms.
3. The program will now iterate through all acronyms starting with atleast 2 capital letters. The acronyms will be searched in google -> wikipedia and its description from the first paragraph will be printed out.
